# Operators allows to perform various types of operations on one or more variables.
# Generally, mathematical, logical and comparision operators are used most often

# Mathematical operators:
# All arithmetic operators are mathematical operators like +, -, *, /, %, //.
print(2 + 3)
print(3 - 2)
print(2 * 3)
print(3 / 2)
print(3 % 2)
print(3 // 2)

# Logical operators:
# AND, OR, NOT etc are the examples of logical operators.
var_a = True
var_b = False   
print(var_a and var_b)
print(var_a or var_b)
print(not(var_a and var_b))

# Comparision operators:
# Operators like <, <=, >, >=, ==, != are used to compare two elements.
if (2 > 3):
    print("It is true")
else:
    print("It is false")
